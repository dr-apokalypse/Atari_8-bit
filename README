Atari_8-bit

General Info
------------
This Repository contains the sources and binaries
I have created as I attempt to learn to program
my 130xe.  


The .asm files are formatted for ATASM:

http://atari.miribilist.com/atasm/

which is a command-line cross compiler that is 
semi-compatible with OSS Mac/65, an assembler / editor
package written for the Atari 8-bit machines way back 
in the eighties.  Apparently it was something like
the "gold standard."  I have chosen it for its extensive
suite of built-in directives and pseudo-ops.


The .c files and related formats are written for cc65:

http://www.cc65.org/

which is a smallC cross compiler for 6502-based machines.


The .xex files are 6502-native compiled binary code.  To test
them, I use Altirra:

http://www.virtualdub.org/altirra.html

an excellent emulator for pc.  When I want to run them on the
real hardware, I use lotharek's sio2sd:
